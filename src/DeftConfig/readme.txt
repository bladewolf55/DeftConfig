DeftConfig
==========

Features
--------
* Adds the more flexible "base config" approach to your  web. and app.config transformations.
* Makes it easier to keep sensitive transforms out of source control.
* Transforms .config files on F5/F6 build, and Publish.
* Searches a consistent user profile folder for transform files, great for Windows-based continuous integration.

Configuration
-------------
A command line utility named InitializeDeftConfig was written to the project's root. Run this utility to configure the project to use the targets as intended.
